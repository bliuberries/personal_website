  description: 'Creating this from scratch really tested my abilities as a developer. I would constantly build something out, and then delete it just to rebuild it again differently. The way I import images and handle how I manipulate files so that I can go straight to an individual piece that I want to change with ease. My favorite and most hated thing about this project was being able to change the color of the header based on what page I was on. I probably re-wrote that piece of code five times, changing small bits between multiple files before ultimately being satisfied with how I decoupled it. What I learned about this is that perfection is not a destination but a journey and a never ending one at that.',
