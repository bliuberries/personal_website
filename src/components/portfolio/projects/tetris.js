  description: 'Tetris was a fun project where I decided to first test my abilities as a developer. From introducing the notion of "gravity" to blocks being stackable, to making them disappear was a painfully fun process. Overall, I learned a lot about DOM manipulation through this project and I plan on expanding my horizon for future projects to test new areas of expertise.',
