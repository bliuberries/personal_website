  description: 'This project was created with my previous experience as an IT Technician in mind. Reading and discerning data can often times become convoluted. To make things simpler, I have am in the process of creating my own IT ticket tracking dashboard that involves using a heatmap so that you can see the concentration of tickets in any given location. This is still an on going project. However, if you are curious I am willing to dive a bit deeper into what I expect to come of this. Feel free to shoot me an email with any questions!',
