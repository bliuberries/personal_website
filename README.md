#Brady Liu

This is my personal website that I built to display all my skills, projects, and experience. The design was molded after browsing through a plethora of other websites. I picked out what I liked and got to work. I'm pretty proud of my creation, but I'm also open to any suggestions on how it could be improved, or any kind of general comments at all.
